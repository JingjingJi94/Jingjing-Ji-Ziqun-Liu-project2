### 4.1 Challenges in the Assignment
We encountered some challenges during front-end debugging. The `index.css` file that came with the project setup interfered with our own CSS styles, resulting in effects that were not as desired. The browser’s inspect tool helped us drill down into the problem, allowing us to resolve the issue of conflicting classes with the same name, which were causing the interfering effects.

### 4.2 Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make?
We would implement a dynamic resizing feature to improve the user experience on mobile devices. Currently, our website uses a vertical scroll bar on small screens. By incorporating responsive design techniques, such as flexible layouts, media queries, and viewport adjustments, the website would automatically adjust to smaller screen sizes, providing a smoother and more intuitive browsing experience for mobile users. We would also like to improve the AI’s logic so that every time it hits a player’s board, it will only explore the surrounding cells for its next move. This approach is reasonable because ship placements occupy consecutive cells, and targeting the surrounding cells increases the likelihood of hitting a ship.

### 4.3 What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
We assumed that the user will not try to alter the content of the website.

### 4.4 How long did this assignment take to complete?
20 hours in total from both team members.
